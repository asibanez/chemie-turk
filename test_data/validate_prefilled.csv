The bond length was successfully determined with a high degree of accuracy in the crystal structures of 1a , 1b , and 2b , which allowed us to examine the bonding characteristics of these compounds.

Extension of the central π-electron unit from a thienoquinoid unit to a thienothienoquinoid unit caused a huge red shift of 44 nm for 2a in contrast to that of 1a due to narrowing of the HOMO − LUMO gap through the extension of π-conjugation.

The trend for the K1 values ( Table 1 ) shows a general preference for more charge- dense / basic halides as the bond acceptor ( Cl− > Br− > I− ) , which allows for a stronger electrostatic as well as charge- transfer interaction. Nevertheless , the soft halides are also strongly bound , which is tentatively assigned to a larger covalent contribution toward the halogen bond interactions compared to that of the analogous hydrogen bond systems.29,33 In comparison to the halides , the complexation of acetate , dihydrogen phosphate , and sulfate is much stronger , which was also found previously in analogous studies43 and is rationalized by the higher basicity of the selected oxo-anions. The observed slight preference for dihydrogen phosphate over acetate is contrary to the higher charge density and basicity of acetate and is thus ascribed to a better ﬁt between the receptor ’s cavity and the tetrahedral anion.

As shown in Scheme 3 , DMAc ( 2a ) could react with varieties of 2-isocyanobiphenyl ( 1 ) to give the expected product in good to excellent chemical yields ( 63 − 87 % ). This reaction could bear several substituents at diﬀerent positions on the aromatic ring withthe isocyano group , including methoxy ( 3b ) , methyl ( 3k ) , chloro ( 3f ) , and ﬂuoro ( 3d,l ) , giving almost the same level of yields. This brief screening discloses that the electronic properties and steric hindrance have no noticeable eﬀect on the reaction eﬃciency. A substrate containing two substituted groups ( methyl ) on the aromatic ring also worked well , giving the corresponding product in 67 % yield ( 3e ). A further substrate scope study was performed to investigate the eﬀect of substituents on the cyclized aromatic ring. All of the reactions could also proceed smoothly , aﬀording the expected product in good yields , even for a strongly electron donating group ( MeO , 3g ) and a strongly electron withdrawing group ( F and CF3 , 3h,j ).

10.1021/acs.joc.5b00119-13,"1-BDP and (Zn)2 - (BDP)2 , which facilitates electron transfer from photoexcited chlorin to BODIPY. is known that phenylethynyl-type linkers provide strong electronic coupling between dyads ’ components and promote ultrafast PET.39 Electronic communication between BODIPY and chlorin can be inferred from absorption and emission spectra of 1-BDP and (Zn)2 - (BDP)2 , which show slight bathochromic shift of both Qy absorption and emission bands , and increased ﬂuorescence quantum yields ( in toluene ) of chlorin components , compared to the benchmark monomers ( see Table 1 ). For 3-BDP and 4-BDP , both absorption and emission maxima and ﬂuorescence quantum yields are identical to those for the corresponding benchmark monomers , which suggests that there is a negligible conjugation between chlorin and BODIPY , which , in turn , may lead to an attenuation of photoinduced electron transfer. However , further systematic time - resolved spectroscopic and electrochemical measurements are necessary to elucidate the exact mechanism of quenching of ﬂuorescence for chlorin components in arrays. In order to further evaluate the applicability of amide - linked BODIPY − chlorin dyads for bioimaging , we compared the quantum yields of ﬂuorescence for the chlorin component in arrays upon excitation at the BODIPY absorption , in various solvents ( toluene , MeOH , DMSO , DMF ; Table S1 , Supporting Information ). The data show that the dyads 3-BDP , 4-BDP , and Zn4 - BDP retain relatively high ﬂuorescence quantum yields in solvents of diﬀerent polarities. Fluorescence for these arrays is comparable in toluene , DMF , and DMSO , and modestly reduced in MeOH ( on average ﬂuorescence quantum yields in MeOH are 0.71-fold of that in toluene ). Finally , we compared the ﬂuorescence intensity for dyads vs monomers upon excitation at ∼ 500 nm , at the same concentration.

10.1021/acs.joc.5b00198-3,"Chiral phosphoric acids ( CPAs ) belong to a class of privileged organocatalysts , which have enabled a variety of enantioselective transformations.6 Moreover , 2-vinylindoles have recently been utilized as dienes to participate in a number of catalytic asymmetric Diels − Alder reactions or formal [ 4 + 2 ] cycloadditions.7 However , this diene species has never been employed to the Diels − Alder reactions with methyleneindoli- nones8 to construct a spiro[tetrahydrocarbazole-3,3′-oxindole] motif.

While these conditions did not ensure rigorous exclusion of oxygen , this experiment indicates that performing the reaction in the presence or absence of oxygen has no eﬀect on the product selectivity or the rate of reaction for the time scale that was measured. This data strongly suggests that molecular oxygen is not functioning as an adventitious oxidant of dihydronaph- thalene 31b to naphthalene 31a.

A strategy to eliminate the catalyst involves preactivation of the reagents , by using , for example , strained alkynes in the reaction.5 Coupling reactions that involve activated azides are less studied.6 One example involves the thioacid / azide amidation reaction , ﬁrst discovered in the 1980s,7 and reinvestigated in the past decade.8 Various azides can react with thiocarboxylic acids ( −CSOH or −COSH ) to form amide bonds while releasing nitrogen gas and elemental sulfur. Azides having electron - withdrawing groups generally display kinetics considerably faster than those of their electron- rich counterparts. This is in contrast to Staudinger ligation and azide − alkyne cycloaddition , where electron - rich azides show higher the thioacid-azide reaction has been proposed to proceed by stepwise nucleophilic addition to give intermediate I , followed by cyclization to thiotriazoline intermediate ( II ) , and ﬁnal extrusion of N2S to give the amide product ( Scheme 1 ). 8b","2, 3, 18, 19, 21, 22, 116, 117, 125, 126, 133, 134, 135, 136, 151, 152, 158, 159, 164, 165, 173, 174, 199, 200, 208, 209, 212, 213, 232, 233, 246, 247",,,,,,,,,
10.1021/acs.joc.5b00241-14,"In contrast , ATH of short - chain aliphatic β-ketoesters catalyzed by catalyst 2 only provided poor enantioselectivity ( e.g. , 31 % ee for 32a , Figure 6 ). It implied that the CH − π interaction between the Cp* group of the catalyst and the ester function of the β-substrate is too weak to stabilize the transition state , thus leading to poor enantioselectivity for short - chain aliphatic substrates. However , the strong hydrophobic inter- action between the long alkyl chain of the substrate and the aliphatic tail of the catalyst in the metallomicelle core may greatly improve the stability of the catalytic transition state ( Figure 5 ) , resulting in high enantioselectivities in thus long - chain aliphatic β-ketoesters ( 86 − 91 % ee , reduction of Table 2 , entry 9 − 12 ). It is also consistent with the observation that poor enantioselectivity ( 11 % ee , Table 2 , entry 13 ) was obtained for long - chain aliphatic β-ketoester substrates using Rh - TsDPEN catalyst due to lack of strong hydrophobic attraction in the transition state. In the case of aliphatic γ- ketoesters , we propose that the aliphatic γ-ketoesters may have the same mechanism as β-ketoesters. We also investigated the mechanism of aliphatic ketoesters bearing acetyl ketone group ( 21−29a ). We propose that the absolute conﬁgurations was controlled with a similar mecha- nism as that of aliphatic ketones ( SI Figure S8),10b but the ester group of the substrate may have some interaction with the catalyst playing a negative role on the transition state , which could be explained by the phenomena that decreasing the space of to lower enantioselectivity ( Table 3 entries 1 − 5 ).

In these cases , longer reaction times were needed and a reversed aldehyde / alkyne ratio was found to be successful to easily separate the desired product from the starting alkyne. The benzannulation of symmetrical alkynes 6g and 6h led to naphthalenes 7g and 7h in 46 % and 49 % yield , respectively. The eﬀectiveness of this catalytic reaction was further demonstrated by reacting 4-phenyl-but-3-yn-2-one 6i , which aﬀorded the corresponding 2-acetyl-substituted naph- thalene 7i in moderate 46 % isolated yield. To the best of our knowledge , this represents the ﬁrst example based on the use of an alkyne deactivated by an electron - withdrawing group in related aldehyde − alkyne benzannulation processes. Similarly to the GaCl3 - catalyzed transformation developed by Li et al.,6 we observed inferior reactivity for phenylacetylene 6j.

10.1021/acs.joc.5b00355-0,ABSTRACT : The ﬁrst total synthesis of trichoaurantianolides C and D is described. An enantiocontrolled pathway leads to rapid construction of the tricyclic carbon skeleton and establishes the trans-dimethyl geometry of the quaternary bridgehead carbons via a reductive cyclization. Application of the π-allyl Stille cross-coupling leads to a nonracemic allylic alcohol as a prerequisite for the introduction of asymmetry in the cycloheptane system. Two strategies have been examined for elaboration of the unsaturated tetrahydrofuranyl ring from a common tricyclic intermediate. These eﬀorts reveal a number of unanticipated issues of reactivity and signiﬁcant stereochemical requirements for a novel acyloin rearrangement as well as the elimination and cyclodehydration of chiral α-hydroxy ketones. Key reactions leading to completion of the synthesis include the stereoselective addition of isopropenyllithium TMEDA complex and a facile chemoselective oxidation with selenium dioxide .,"7, 8, 23, 24, 28, 29, 34, 35, 42, 43, 49, 50, 50, 51, 61, 62, 97, 98, 124, 125",,,,,,,,,

The conformational preference of the arabinosyl oxocarbenium ions ( 45 − 47 ) is less profound than the preference of the corresponding ribo-oxocarbenium ions ( 42 − 44 ). This may be due to the fact that the C2 and C3 substituents can not simultaneously adopt their most favorable orientation in either of the envelope structures.

To overcome this problem , nitrones 1b having acid- removable acetal - type substituents including glycosyl groups have been employed.2 Recently , N-Boc3 substituted and N- nosyl4 substituted nitrones 1c and 1d were reported to provide isoxazolidines having electron - withdrawing protective groups that facilitate reductive cleavage of N − O bond and that can be readily removed. In this context , N-nonsubstituted isoxazoli- dines 5 would also be attractive since they can be protected with usual N-protective groups such as carbamate and sulfonyl groups. One of the simplest ways to synthesize N-non- substiuted isoxazolidines would be intramolecular oxime − oleﬁn cycloadditions ( IOOC ) of oximes having oleﬁn moieties 3 via N-nonsubstituted nitrones 4.5 However , most of these reactions require high temperature and long reaction periods.

10.1021/acs.joc.5b00572-1,"heterocycles ( i.e. , a pyrrole and an imidazole ) , building the central pyridine through the union of the smaller systems. It was hoped that the construction of the pyridine in this manner would obviate many of the challenges present in the original synthesis , minimize functional group interconversions , and result in a simpler and more eﬃcient approach to our desired heterocycle 1. Out of the three potential “ ring - forming ” bond formations within this strategy , we focused on disconnecting the 1,2-C − N bond via a proposed 6π-cyclization13 of amidine 2. The synthesis of this key intermediate would come from coupling a C5 - activated cyanoimidazole 3 with the known bromopyrrole 4.14 Despite the lack of solid precedent for amidine electrocyclizations of this type , we felt that the ease of many electrocyclizations,15 coupled with the potential for multiple conditions to mediate this key cyclization , supported the exploration of this strategy. Herein we describe the realization of this approach and the development of a Ni- mediated cyclization , which enabled the eﬃcient construction of this highly functionalized pyrrolopyridine in just 8 steps and 29 % overall yield.16 ■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION In order to evaluate the proposed 6π-electrocyclization , it was necessary to synthesize the pyrrole − imidazole 7 ( Scheme 1 ). We proposed to accomplish this via a Suzuki coupling , starting from the C4 - brominated pyrrole 4. Preparation of the known 4- bromopyrrole 4 was accomplished in two steps from trichloroacetylpyrrole,17 which was followed by N-ethylation to give the N-ethylpyrrole 5 ( Scheme 1 ). The borylation of electron - rich heteroaromatic compounds can be diﬃcult due to the general the resulting electron - rich boronates ; 18 indeed , the formation of pyrrole 6 proved challenging. Initial screening results indicated that a combina- tion of KOAc / Pd(OAc)2 / Cy3P in toluene was capable of giving high yields of the desired boronate 6 ( > 95 % conversion with ∼ 99 : 1 selectivity for Miyaura borylation over proto-dehaloge- nation ).

The emission spectrum of 1 is well resolved in hexane solution , but is broad and featureless in THF and MeCN solutions with a solvatochromic shift of up to 1920 cm−1 , indicating that the emission is from a π − π* state in a nonpolar environment and from a state of greater charge- transfer character in more polar solvents. In contrast , the emission of 2 is more weakly solvatochromic , shifting only 330 cm−1 from hexane to MeCN solutions. It exhibits sharp , well- resolved emission in all three solvents with an average vibrational spacing between the most prominent bands of ca. 1350 cm−1 ( assigned to an average of aromatic ring vibrational modes ) , and thus a pure π − π* description is appropriate for the emission in all solvents studied. This is also revealed by its long pure - radiative lifetime , τ 0 , in hexane solution of 140 ns. The emission of 3 is similar to that of 1 , albeit slightly red- shifted ( 530 cm−1 in hexane solution ) and with an increased maximum solvatochromic shift of 2100 cm−1. The pure radiative lifetimes of these two compounds are also similar ( τ 0 = 40 ns ( 1 ) and 65 ns ( 3 ) in hexane solutions ) with little solvent dependence. Furthermore , 1 and 3 have shorter τ 0 values than 2 in hexane solution ; the τ 0 value of 2 also has a moderate solvent dependence , shortening to 78 ns in MeCN solution.

As expected , the lowest rotational barrier is calculated for compound 31 ( 13.2 kcal / mol by MM2 , Figure 4 , and 10.0 kcal / mol by DFT ) , where the most stable conformation is with the phenyl ring twisted around 52 ° with respect to the indacene core. The presence of a ﬂuorine atom at the ortho position in 38 hinders the phenyl motion as reﬂected in a higher rotational barrier ( 18.6 kcal / mol by MM2 , Figure 4 , and 15.7 kcal / mol by DFT ) and a higher twisting angle ( 60 ° ). However , owing to its small size , the steric hindrance seems not to be high because its ﬂuorescence eﬃciency is still low ( 8.7 % , Table 4 ). Further evidence is provided by compound 12 bearing an o-bromine. Its larger size should induce a higher steric hindrance to the phenyl motion , reﬂected in a higher rotational barrier ( 28.1 kcal / mol by MM2 and 25.1 kcal / mol by DFT ) and a more twisted 8-phenyl ( 65 ° ) , which leads to an improved ﬂuorescence signal ( 29.5 % Table 4 ).

10.1021/acs.joc.5b00733-15,"■ CONCLUSIONS In summary , we have demonstrated the ligand - assisted palladium - catalyzed regioselective oxidative C(sp2)−H activa- tion for dehydrogenative homocoupling and C − H oxygen- ation reactions in the phenyl ring of substituted 1-phenyl- pyrazoles. The scope has been explicitly investigated to demonstrate the eﬀect of diﬀerent substitutions on the outcome of the set of compounds wherein the pyrazole ring does not bear any substitution under low quantities of TFA / TFAA ( 9 : 1 , v / v ) mixture ( higher substrate concentration ) aﬀorded the biaryl bis-pyrazoles via dehydrogenative homocoupling exclusively. However , resulted in the ( o- hydroxyphenyl)pyrazoles as the major products when the identical reaction was performed in the presence of an increased quantity of TFA / TFAA ( 9 : 1 , v / v ) mixture ( low substrate concentration ). Further , if the phenyl ring carried an ortho-substituent then monohy- droxylation took place but if both the ortho-positions were free then bis-hydroxylation prevailed under the conditions. Unlike in the set of compounds where the pyrazole ring carried the carboxylate group at the 3-position , in most of the cases a mixture of biaryl bis-pyrazoles and (o-hydroxyphenyl)- pyrazoles were formed under higher substrate concentration , but (o-hydroxyphenyl)pyrazoles were isolated in superior yields when the concentration of the starting material was low. In addition for these starting substrates , the protocol worked only when both ortho-positions of the phenyl ring were free since all compounds bearing an ortho-substituted phenyl the pyrazole substrates bearing a carboxylate group at the C-5 or C-4 position , mostly biaryl bis-pyrazoles were isolated. Interestingly , for the pyrazoles bearing a phenyl group at the C-3 position in place of the carboxylate group at lower substrate concentration we could isolate only the ( o- hydroxyphenyl)pyrazole with no trace of biaryl bis-pyrazoles.

10.1021/acs.joc.5b00742-0,"ABSTRACT : Invader probes have been proposed as alternatives to polyamides , triplex - forming oligonucleotides , and peptide nucleic acids for recognition of chromosomal DNA targets. These double- stranded probes are activated for DNA recognition by + 1 interstrand zippers of pyrene - functionalized nucleotides. This particular motif forces the intercalating pyrene moieties into the same region , resulting in perturbation and destabilization of the probe duplex. In contrast , the two probe strands display very high aﬃnity toward complementary DNA. The energy diﬀerence between the probe duplexes and recognition complexes provides the driving force for DNA recognition. In the present study , we explore the properties of Invader probes based on larger intercalators , i.e. , perylene and coronene , expecting that the larger π-surface area will result in additional destabilization of the probe duplex and further stabilization of probe − target duplexes , in eﬀect increasing the thermodynamic driving force for DNA recognition. Toward this end , we developed protocols for 2′-N-methyl-2′-amino-2′- deoxyuridine phosphoramidites that are functionalized at the N2′ - position with pyrene , perylene , or coronene moieties and incorporated these monomers into oligodeoxyribonucleotides ( ONs ).

Ab- sorption spectra of the compounds are inﬂuenced by the substitution pattern and chromophore number density. Compounds containing 2,7-substitution exhibited red - shifted absorption , while the chromophore loading on the other positions led to the increment in molar extinction coeﬃcients due to the increase in the chromophore density. Multiple substitutions resulted in twisting of chromophores and aﬀected the π-electrons , which the conjugative delocalization of produced shorter wavelength absorption for the 2,3,6,7- tetrasubstituted derivative. the compounds exhibited excited - state solvatochromism attributable to the structural reorganization - induced electronic perturbations. The solvatochromic data are supportive of a general solvent eﬀect , which is further conﬁrmed by Lippert − Mataga correlation. End- capping with butterﬂy shaped phenothiazine restrained the formation of molecular aggregates in the solid state.

10.1021/acs.joc.5b00793-5,"In 2011 , Corelli and co-workers17b reported the synthesis of 3-phenylquinolin-4(1H)-one 9a through the reaction of 3-iodo- 1-methylquinolin-4(1H)-one 4 with phenylboronic acid 8a ( 1.2 equiv ) using Pd(OAc)2 as the catalyst ( 10 mol % ) , PPh3 as the ligand ( 30 mol % ) in the presence of Na2CO3 ( 2.0 M in H2O , 2.5 equiv ) in DME / EtOH ( 1.5 : 1 ) under microwave irradiation at 70 ° C for 5 min. 3-Phenylquinolin-4(1H)-one 9a was obtained in 75 % isolated yield. On the basis of this protocol , we performed the reaction of 4 with phenylboronic acid 8a ( 1.5 equiv ) in water at 100 ° C using sodium carbonate ( 1.0 equiv ) as the base and Pd(OAc)2 ( 5 mol % ) as the catalyst under ohmic heating using TBAB ( 0.1 equiv ) as the phase transfer catalyst ( PTC ). PTC has long been recognized as a versatile methodology for organic synthesis in industry , academia , and in process chemistry and is particularly suitable when substrates are insoluble in the reaction medium , as is the case of 1- substituted-3-iodoquinolin-4(1H)-ones 4 and 6.18 Under these conditions , 3-phenylquinolin-4(1H)-one 9a was obtained in 75 % isolated yield after 30 min reaction time ( Table 1 , entry 1 ). An extensive optimization of the reaction parameters led us to study ( i ) the eﬀect of using the PTC ( TBAB addition ) , ( ii ) the eﬀect of Pd catalyst addition , and ( iii ) the reaction time. The base , solvent , and temperature used remained unchanged. Using the model reaction depicted in Table 1 , our initial investigations focused on studying the eﬀect of the PTC ( Table 1 , entries 1 and 2 ). A lower yield ( 61 % ) was obtained without the addition of PTC ( TBAB ) , demonstrating that TBAB plays an important role in the eﬃciency of this ligand - free protocol in water. Product 9a was isolated in very good yield ( 80 % ) when the reaction was performed without the addition of Pd(OAc)2 under ohmic heating ( Table 1 , entry 3 ) , but no product was found when the reaction was performed under classical heating conditions without Pd(OAc)2 ( Table 1 , entry 4 ). This result highlights that some contamination of the reaction medium with the palladium catalyst probably comes from the electrodes ( made of 316 stainless steel ) used in ohmic heating in the ﬁrst assay and that such a small quantity of palladium seems to be suﬃcient to give the coupling product in very good yield.

Type I alkenes undergo rapid homodimerization , and these can participate in an ensuing CM event. Type II alkenes undergo slow homodimerization leading to homodimers that can participate in CM to a limited extent. Type III alkenes do not form homodimers , but they are able to react with type I and II homodimers in a CM. Type IV alkenes are essentially “ spectators to cross-metathesis ” as they do not display any activity toward the catalyst. For a selective CM , the reaction partners are preferably from diﬀerent types. The two allylic alcohols at hand are classiﬁed as type II CM partners , making the desired CM reaction a challenging process.
