10.1021/acs.joc.5b00002-6,"To understand these novel processes , 3a-hydroxyisoxazolo- [3,2-a]isoindol-8(3aH)-one derivative 3 and (E)-3-methylene- isoindolin-1-one 4a were treated under diﬀerent conditions ( Scheme 2 ). We found that compound 3a could be eﬀectively transformed to (E)-3-methyleneisoindolin-1-one 4a in the presence of a catalytic amount of both K2CO3 and Bu3P at 60 ° C , while it was fully transformed to (Z)-3-methylene- isoindolin-1-one 5a at 150 ° C in the presence of Bu3P or at 100 ° C in the presence of K2CO3. We also found that (E)-3- methyleneisoindolin-1-one 4a could be eﬀectively transformed to (Z)-3-methyleneisoindolin-1-one 5a in the presence of a catalytic amount of both K2CO3 and Bu3P at a higher temperature , which shows a novel example that the (E)- conﬁguration of the carbon − carbon double bond could be transformed to the (Z)-conﬁguration of the carbon − carbon double bond. It is worth mentioning here that compound 3a could also be transformed to (E)-3-methyleneisoindolin-1-one 4a and (Z)-3-methyleneisoindolin-1-one 5a in the absence of catalyst , and compound 4a could also be transformed to its isomer 5a. There is an obvious intramolecular hydrogen bonding of the N − H group of 5a in its crystal structure , and this could be the cause of the Z-stereoselectivity under higher temperature.13","12, 13, 33, 34, 44, 45, 46, 47, 59, 60, 69, 70, 92, 93, 103, 104, 105, 106, 122, 123, 124, 125, 135, 136, 137, 138, 153, 154, 156, 157, 180, 181","[""Temperature"",""Reactants""]","[""27,28"",""""]","[""3a"",""""]","[""33,34,34,35"",""""]","[""(E)-3-methyleneisoindolin-1-one 4a"",""""]","["""",""""]","["""",""""]","["""",""""]","["""",""""]","44,45,46,47",K2CO3 Bu3P,"["""",""""]","["""",""""]","[""48,51"",""""]","[""60 ° C"",""""]","["""",""""]","["""",""""]","[""Save and annotate another reaction"",""Save and annotate another reaction""]",,,,,
