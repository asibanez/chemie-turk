To keep the size of this library small, the data file that the 
script partsofspeech.js requires isn't included.

You can get the "Part Of Speech Database" from:

http://wordlist.sourceforge.net/

Unpack the data into this directory so that the 'pos' directory
is a direct subdirectory of this one. The script tries to open the
file `./pos/part-of-speech.txt`.
